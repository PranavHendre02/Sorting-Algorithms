# **Sorting Algorithms Visualization**

"Welcome to the Sorting Algorithms Visualization project! This interactive Java-based application offers an engaging and intuitive way to explore and understand the inner workings of various sorting algorithms. Experience sorting techniques in real-time, with step-by-step visualizations that make learning algorithms both fun and educational!!!"

## Application Overview
The Sorting Algorithms Visualization is a Java-based project that demonstrates how different sorting algorithms arrange data through step-by-step visual animations. Using Java Swing, this project allows users to visualize sorting processes like Insertion Sort, Quick Sort, and Merge Sort with dynamic and smooth animations.

## How to Run the Application

### Clone the Repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Kvr-10/Sorting-Algorithms.git
```
### Navigate to the Artifacts Directory:
After cloning the repository, navigate to the following path:
```
Sorting-Algorithms/out/artifacts/Sortings_jar/Sortings.jar
```
### Run the Game:
Locate the `Sortings.jar` file in the directory.  
Double-click on `Sortings.jar` to start the sorting visualization.

## Alternative
You can directly download the JAR file from the [Releases page](https://github.com/Kvr-10/Sorting-Algorithms/releases/latest) and run it.  
Download [Quiz-Application](https://github.com/Kvr-10/Sorting-Algorithms/releases/latest/download/Sortings.jar) game.

## Prerequisites
Ensure you have Java installed on your system. You can download and install the latest version of Java from the [official website](https://www.java.com/en/).

## Features
- **Insertion Sort**: A simple sorting algorithm that sorts incrementally by building a sorted list.
- **Quick Sort**: A fast divide-and-conquer sorting method that efficiently organizes data.
- **Merge Sort**: A powerful, stable algorithm that recursively divides the data and merges sorted subarrays.
- **Real-Time Visualization**: Step-by-step animated sorting to make learning fun and interactive.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Intuitive GUI developed using Java Swing for a seamless experience.

## Skills
- **Java Programming**: Core programming language for implementing and visualizing sorting algorithms.
- **GUI Development**: Dynamic and interactive user interface using Java Swing.
- **Algorithm Optimization**: Efficiently implemented algorithms for performance.
- **Data Visualization**: Real-time visualization of sorting processes for better understanding.
